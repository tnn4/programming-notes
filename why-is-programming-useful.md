It's obvious that good programmers, more generally, people who are good at understanding and using computer systems are in huge demand.

Why?

This begs the questions: why are computers useful?

Computers store state.

Computers carry out functions that transform state and they do it cheaply, efficiently.

Computers reduce the cost of information processing exponentially.

What have the invention of computers done for the economy?

What would the economy look like without computers or computer networks?

No instant communication( transporting information ). Difficulty in storing information.

What is information? Why is it important?

How is information used in real life?

Applications of computer systems?
Banks need to deal with information. They need to store information about ownership. They keep property safe. Secure wealth.

Refer: Medici banking innovation "of the general ledger system through the development of the double entry system of tracking debits and credits or deposits and withdrawals." This system led to the Medicis becoming one of the wealthiest and powerful families in Europe. Some of the Medicis became the defacto head of state. From bean counters to kings. Not bad at all. They didn't have computers though.

What was the underlying useful function?

Accounting deals with ownership. Bookkeeping.

It seems programming and accounting/finance are deeply similar.

double entry system: storing state, keeping track of truth

Refer: blockchain, another innovation using computer systems to solve the problem of keeping track of state

These systems are secure by design and are required for maintaining trust which allows transactions to occurs in an economy.

Proper accounting reduces the cost of transactions.

The protocols that are useful for financial transactions in banks and financial systems are generally useful for any application.

Why is processing bit patterns so useful?

Ownership
Programming.Rust: who owns Memory
Finance.Banks: who owns Wealth/property
