A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. 

Properties can be used as if they're public data members, 
but they're special methods called accessors. 

This feature enables data to be accessed easily and still helps promote the safety and flexibility of methods.

Properties enable a class to expose a public way of getting and setting values, while hiding implementation or verification code.
