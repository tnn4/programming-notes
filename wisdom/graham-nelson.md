This is the paradox of modern open source. Never have so many large programs been so openly readable as now. But their size and complexity is defeating. Their structure is often unexplained. They’re full of unfathomable relationships which are implied by the code but never explicitly written down.

Many people love the aesthetics of mathematical abstraction when they look at software. A beauty cold and austere, you might say, like the perfect way this car engine all interlocks.

And I do feel that lure. But real-world programs are about the fuzzy needs of real humans. I don’t think the ideal presentation of a program is a proof that it is mathematically correct. Instead, I’d like to borrow a standard tool from the social sciences.

That tool is the “thick description”. The term is attributed jointly to Gilbert Ryle and Clifford Geertz – I’ve never known how to pronounce that. It broadly means: describe not just the facts, but also how people understand them or behave around them.
