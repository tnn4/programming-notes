I await your promise to resolve.

await basically forces async functions to come back in the right order

etymology
wait is a verb
e.g. he waits is valid
await is a transitive and requires an object
e.g. `he waits` is valid, but `he awaits` is not valid because you need an object to use it
e.g. `he awaits a bus` is valid
