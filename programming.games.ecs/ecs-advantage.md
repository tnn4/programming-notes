The main architectural advantage of ECS for me is execution order and call stack depth. In OOP, you will often have a function on an object that calls another function on another object that calls another function, etc. You add event driven code to this where an event fires and anything can be listening (UI, other objects) and your game quickly becomes a tangled mess where it is difficult to immediately determine what is being called when and why. Conversely in ECS you have systems that are executed in a fixed order and are very “flat” in terms of their call stacks. This makes it incredibly easy to understand exactly what is happening and when, which leads to way fewer bugs. It’s a natural fit for games too since they are frame-based - input processing systems at the beginning of a frame, gameplay logic in the middle, ui at the end for instance. In OOP, the execution order becomes a web of nonsense super fast - input fires an event that updates the character that fires an event that updates the ui, next input is processed and another chain is fired and on and on.

There are many other advantages but that’s the main one for me, hope that helps!
