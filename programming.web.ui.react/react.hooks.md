In React, useState, as well as any other function starting with ”use”, is called a Hook.

Hooks are special functions that are only available while React is rendering

Warning
- Hooks are limited functions
- Hooks(functions starting with use) can only be called at the top level
- They cannot be called in conditions, loops or other nested functions
