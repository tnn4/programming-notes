Props are the information that you pass to a JSX tag. For example, `className`, `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` are some of the props you can pass to an <img>.

Props are read-only snapshots in time.

You can think of props like “knobs” that you can adjust. They serve the same role as arguments serve for functions—in fact, props are the only argument to your component! React component functions accept a single argument, a props object

Props are immutable. Do not try to change props.

Usage:

function({props1, props2}){

}
