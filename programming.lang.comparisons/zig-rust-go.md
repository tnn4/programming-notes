Go is simplicity on the surface with gobs and gobs of complexity hiding under the internals, that hopefully you never, ever have to touch. If you haven't yet gotten upset @ Go for the the evil details it tries to hide, keep using Go.

Rust is "saner c++" i.e. it's complicated and spews it's complications everywhere, but hopefully in a more modern, easier to understand and safer way. If you don't need the complications, I'd recommend staying away.

Zig is "saner C", i.e. it's trying to get rid of the wacky complications of C that now make little to no sense anymore, but stick around because changing C is hard, complicated and miserable. If you find yourself using the C interop stuff from Go all the time and you find it frustrating, it might be time to switch to something like Zig.

Zig would be a fine language to wander into from Go, if you need the complications that it brings, but if you don't, I'd recommend just staying in Go land. See the first paragraph ;)
